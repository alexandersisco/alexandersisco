# 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander
- 🏗️ Cofounder & Lead Developer at [Speare.com](https://speare.com), where I've designed, built, launched, and supported long-term a powerful web application for writers and authors.
- 🖥️ Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience, from modern TypeScript, Go, and SQL professionally to low-level C and Zig in my never-ending quest for deeper understanding.
- ⚡ I specialize in crafting web applications for creators with a focus on building UXs that feel as polished and performant as native apps.
- 💡 I am curious by nature -- I love digging into the RFCs and the low-level protocols of the web.
- 🌱 My new favorite language might be Zig. Check out [Quiz 9](https://ziggit.dev/t/new-quiz-in-ziglings-bit-manipulation-in-embedded-devices/8552) which I wrote for [ziglings.org](https://ziglings.org) earlier this year.
