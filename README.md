# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alexander

I'm a self-taught engineer and cofounder of [Speare.com](https://speare.com), where I've spent the last several years building rich, real-time web applications from the ground up. I love the craft of front-end development, writing clean TypeScript, designing React/Next.js applications that scale, and solving tricky problems like collaborative editing and real-time state sync.

Lately, I've been diving into Zig and even contributed [Quiz 9](https://ziggit.dev/t/new-quiz-in-ziglings-bit-manipulation-in-embedded-devices/8552) to [ziglings.org](https://ziglings.org). For me, programming is about curiosity, whether it's exploring low-level systems or pushing the limits of the browser to make web apps feel as smooth as native ones.
