# 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander
- 🏗️ Cofounder & Lead Developer at [Speare.com](https://speare.com), where I've built rich, real-time web applications end-to-end
- 🖥️ Self-taught engineer with 10+ years of experience, from low-level C on microcontrollers to modern TypeScript, React, and Next.js
- ⚡ I specialize in crafting front-end experiences that feel as polished and performant as native apps, with a focus on code that is resilient in the face of change.
- 💡 I am curious by nature -- I love digging under the hood and getting into the low-level protocols of the web.
- 🌱 My new favorite language might be Zig. Check out my contribution to [Quiz 9](https://ziggit.dev/t/new-quiz-in-ziglings-bit-manipulation-in-embedded-devices/8552) to [ziglings.org](https://ziglings.org) earlier this year.
